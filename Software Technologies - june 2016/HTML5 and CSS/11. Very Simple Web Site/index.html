            <p>HTML5[note 1] is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.</p>
            <p>It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[2][3] to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humansâ€”and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[4]</p>
            <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[5] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
